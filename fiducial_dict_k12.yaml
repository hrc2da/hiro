5: "I know this is a very scary time for them but how a family treats and interacts with them in this time is going to be pivotal."
6: "I think the whole view of education is distorted. Like they really didn't think we were working. Glorified babysitters is what people think sometimes."

36: "I haven't cancelled on my kids. I won't. I never will."
37: "My counterpart and I crash course taught ourselves Google Classroom in a matter of 3 days to be ready to go."

40: "The fear and anxiety of knowing that our students' learning has been interrupted, it is a change."
41: "We have to work in teams with all the other elementary schools so all 4th graders in the district are getting the same."
